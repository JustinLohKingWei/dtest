# Dtest Summary

# How to run
 

# Assumptions taken

- If an invalid value is detected in any of the three tests, only the average between the valid values are computed
- The highest blood sugar level survived by a human is 2656 mg/dl according to this [source](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-blood-sugar-level/?fb_comment_id=811257658947726_974655159274641) , therefore we assume any inputs above this value as faulty and not to be considered.
- We shall also assume that a blood glucose level can be exceedingly low in a person , but not zero at any given time
- Only 3 tests exactly are expected. And format of the given patient data is not subject to change.
- Encoding of received csv files are that of 'ISO-8859-1'
- Only display of 2 decimal places is required
